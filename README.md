Welcome to the Canonical Distribution of MySQL + MySQLRouter.

The objective of this page is to provide directions to get up and running with Canonical MySQL charms.

## Installation

Currently, we support this distribution with Ubuntu 20.04.

To deploy the bundle to a bootstrapped juju controller, simply run

```shell
juju deploy mysql-bundle
```

## Bundle Components
- [mysql](https://charmhub.io/mysql): A k8s charm to deploy MySQL with Group Replication.
- [mysql-router](https://charmhub.io/mysql-router) - a k8s charm to deploy MySQL Router.
- [tls-certificates-operator](https://charmhub.io/tls-certificates-operator) - TLS operator. Note: The TLS settings in bundles use self-signed-certificates which are not recommended for production clusters, the tls-certificates-operator charm offers a variety of configurations, read more on the TLS charm [here](https://charmhub.io/tls-certificates-operator).
